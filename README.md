# U.S. Chronic Disease Analysis (COPD & Obesity)

This project analyzes the **U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators dataset** (from data.gov/CDC) to explore, visualize, and model trends in **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)** and **Obesity**.  
The goal is to extract insights for **public health policy** and provide **individual recommendations** for prevention.

## üìä Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values (median imputation for numeric, constant fill for categorical).
- Converted `DataValue` to numeric for analysis.
- Dropped columns with >80% missing values.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution of indicators across states & years.
- Identified **COPD** and **Obesity** as focus diseases for deeper analysis.

### 3. Choropleth Maps
- Created **state-level prevalence maps** to visualize geographic hotspots.
- Useful for public health officials to see where interventions are most needed.

### 4. Trends Over Time
- Analyzed **yearly trends** in COPD and Obesity prevalence.
- Compared both diseases side-by-side to highlight long-term shifts.

### 5. Predictive Modeling
- Built a **RandomForest Classifier** with median-split target (high vs. low prevalence).
- Evaluated performance with accuracy & ROC-AUC.
- Extracted **feature importances** to identify major drivers of disease prevalence.

### 6. Interpretability
- Used SHAP (if available) for model explanation.
- Highlighted which factors contribute most to disease burden.

### 7. Recommendations
**Policy Level**
- Target high-prevalence states with more resources (prevention campaigns, healthcare access).
- Monitor trends yearly to adjust strategies.

**Individual Level**
- Promote smoking cessation programs (COPD prevention).
- Encourage healthy diet & physical activity (Obesity prevention).
- Regular screening in high-risk populations.

üìà Key Insights

Obesity prevalence is rising faster than COPD in many regions.

Geographic hotspots show clear disparities (some states consistently higher).

Models highlight lifestyle and demographic factors as major drivers.


üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Impact

This project goes beyond modeling by tying data insights back to public health action.
It shows how data science + healthcare can work together to shape better prevention strategies.
